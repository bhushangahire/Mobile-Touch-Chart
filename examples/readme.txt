The example is based on original sample of Sencha Touch 1.1.0.

Please copy this examples folder to secha-touch-1.1.0 and override original examples folder. "index.html" in examples root folder will be overrided. Put the Sencha touch folder to a web server(like Tomcat), then you can access sencha touch examples in your iPhone/Touch/iPad. You will find a charting entry at the end of example list. Enjoy it!
